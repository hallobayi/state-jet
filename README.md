# âš¡ fast-state: Ultra-Lightweight Global State for React

A zero-boilerplate, ultra-fast global state management library for React. No context, reducers, or providersâ€”just simple reactive state.

## ðŸš€ Why fast-state?
- âœ… **No Context, No Providers** â€“ Works outside React, reducing unnecessary re-renders.
- âœ… **Automatic Re-Renders** â€“ Only components using specific state values update.
- âœ… **Super Lightweight** â€“ Less than **1KB** minified!
- âœ… **SSR & Next.js Support** â€“ Works on both client and server.

## ðŸ›  Installation
```bash
npm install state-jet
```
