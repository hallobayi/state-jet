# Contributing to State-jet

We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as
possible.

## The `main` Branch is Unsafe

We will do our best to keep main in good shape, with tests passing at all times. But we will sometimes make API changes that your application might not be compatible with. We will do our best to communicate these changes and always version appropriately so you can lock into a specific version if need be.

## Pull Requests

We actively welcome your pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints and is formatted with prettier. Run yarn format to run prettier on all files.

## Getting in Touch

Please file issues liberally. That's the easiest way to contact us in a way that
ensures everyone working on State-jet can see it. We are eager for your questions, input, and to hear about your experience.

## Issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Please ensure your description is
clear and has sufficient instructions to be able to reproduce the issue.
